# Lab 11

## Overview

In this lab, you are required to implement a collections similar to *java.util.ArrayList*.



## Guide

You may first download the **Lab11_Solution** from github, then you need to finish the following three tasks.

- Write your code in the *MyArrayList*.


- Run the *Evaluation* to check your code.

In the lab, the [Java documentation](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) will be the **best** instructor for you. However, maybe it is a little bit difficult for you, don't worry, **feel free to ask TA for help when needed.**



## Tips

There is **no new knowledge** in the lab, the only thing you need to do is to **read the Java documentation thoroughly**.

If you cannot understand the Java documentation, read it again until you can solve the problem.

Best wishes. 



## Task 1

You need to implement the following methods:

*For more information, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html for help.*

```java
public boolean add(Object o);
public Object get(int index);
public int size();
public int isEmpty();
public Object remove(int index);
public void clear();
```



## Task 2

You need to implement the following methods:

*For more information, refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html for help.*

```java
public boolean contains(Object o);
public int indexOf(Object o);
public int lastIndexOf(Object o);
```



## Task 3

You need to implement the following methods:

**Q: What is an iterator ???**

**A: Wu Ke Feng Gao. See the Java doc. :)**

*For more information refer to http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html for help.*

```java
public Iterator iterator();
```
